      <h2 id = 'section3'> Justification </h2>
      <h3> Legal Process </h3>
      <p> To develop a legal definition of deals alongside the Jet and Walmart legal teams, I utilized outside counsel to understand what precedence had been set for list prices and deals in the past. The most critical determination was what defines a "regular price" from which retailers can claim a discount. California was found to have some of the strictest laws protecting consumers in this area and precedence from cases in California led our definition development process. Because there are no laws specific to dynamic pricing systems, and because "regular prices" are not the same online as they are in store (because online prices can change weekly if not daily), I worked with the legal team to come up with a definition that served the user's best interest.  I wanted to make sure that when a user saw a deal on Jet or Walmart.com, it was clearly a good value based on what prices a user may have seen on the site before.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Competitive Analysis </h3>
      <p> I reviewed how others define a deal as part of my research in coming up with a definition that was good value to users. For Amazon's "deals", I found that deals that are sold by Amazon SxS and contain “was” price (not “list” price) use the highest price that was on site 1-2 months ago regardless of duration.

      <p>Meanwhile, Google had recently launched an additional feature to its PLA tiles to show "price drops" from standard prices as determined by Google. When I looked into Google's definition, I found that they were using a 90-day average price based on historical pricing from PLA feeds.</p>

      <h3> UX Considerations </h3>
      <p> A point of particular contention unique to Jet was the dichotomy between real savings and discounted prices. Whereas deals indicate discounted prices, Jet had the unique value proposition of providing real-time savings based on a variety of factors. While we wanted to make it clear to customers that they had made a smart purchase, we didn't want them to think that their specific unique cart actions had unlocked real savings. We therefore made an explicit design decision to not include deal discounts in any of the "savings" totals we showed in the experience, including the "extra savings" line we showed at the cart checkout page.
